#Project: Implementation of RSA Cryptography,In this  project we encrypt and dycrypt plain english text using RSA cipher

Platform: C#

#INSTRUCTION:
 1. This project implemented on C# Windows Form
 2. We need 3 TextBoxes for Plain Text, Encrypted Text and Decrypted Text and 2 Buttons and labels to mentioned textbox work.
 3. To use the RSA algorithm in C#, we need to add the following namespace which is: using System.Security.Cryptography; 
 4. In this project, user decrypt the simple text and convert it back into simple text
